/**
 * idtk provides utility classes for working with Java identifier names.
 * 
 * <h2>Classes</h2>
 * This library provides four classes that support working with Java 
 * identifier names. {@code Modifier} and {@code Species} are enumerations 
 * that codify Java modifiers and name species (such as class, method etc).
 * {@code SimpleNameTokeniser} does what it says on the tin. It is a very 
 * limited class that will tokenise a lot of names, particularly class 
 * names, but will come unstuck at times. {@code TypeName} represents 
 * Java type names and the various components of type names.
 * 
 * <h2>Caveats</h2>
 * This library is research software and is prone to change, it is also 
 * prone to not being maintained. The APIs of 
 * classes are subject to change, as is the behaviour of classes, and the 
 * number of classes in the library.
